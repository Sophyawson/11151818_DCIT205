## My learning experience
Building a website as a beginner taught me a lot! I started with basic web languages like HTML for creating content, CSS for making things look nice. Git helped me keep track of changes and work with others. Learning about responsive design and other new features. Understanding how the back-end and databases work broadened my perspective. Deploying my site and managing domains seemed complex at first but became clearer. I realized the importance clarity and good design. I'm excited to keep learning in this ever-changing field!
